pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run in development mode
streamlit run main.py --server.runOnSave true
```

#### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add comments for complex logic

#### Testing
- Test with sample data before submitting
- Verify PDF processing with different bank formats
- Test on different operating systems if possible
- Ensure the executable builds successfully

#### Pull Request Process

3. Test thoroughly with sample data
4. Update documentation if needed
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Modules
- **main.py** - Streamlit web interface and main application logic
- **pdf_processor.py** - PDF bank statement extraction and parsing
- **data_cleaner.py** - Data standardization and validation
- **category_engine.py** - Smart categorization with keyword matching
- **export_utils.py** - Data export functionality (CSV, Excel, PDF)

### Key Principles
1. **Zero-coding user experience** - Everything should work out of the box
2. **Graceful error handling** - Always provide helpful error messages
3. **Progressive disclosure** - Show simple options first, advanced options later
4. **Data privacy** - All processing happens locally, no external servers

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Upload CSV files with various formats
- [ ] Upload Excel files (.xlsx, .xls)
- [ ] Upload PDF bank statements from different banks
- [ ] Test categorization accuracy
- [ ] Verify export functionality
- [ ] Test auto-save and backup features
- [ ] Check responsive design on different screen sizes

### Sample Data
Use the provided sample files in `sample_files/` directory for consistent testing.

## üìù Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Add docstrings to all public functions
- Include type hints where helpful
- Document complex algorithms or business logic

### User Documentation
- Update README.md for new features
- Add help text for new UI elements
- Update troubleshooting section for new issues

## üöÄ Release Process

### Version Numbering
- Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- MAJOR: Breaking changes or major new features
- MINOR: New features or significant improvements
- PATCH: Bug fixes and minor improvements

### Building Executables
```bash
# Build for current platform
python build_exe.py

# Test the executable
cd build
./setup.sh  # or setup.bat on Windows
```

## ü§ù Community Guidelines

### Code of Conduct
- Be respectful and inclusive
- Help newcomers learn
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Respect different skill levels and backgrounds

### Communication
- Use clear, jargon-free language
- Provide context for technical discussions
- Be patient with non-technical users
- Celebrate contributions of all sizes

## üêõ Common Issues

### Development Issues
- **Import errors**: Make sure virtual environment is activated
- **Streamlit not updating**: Use `--server.runOnSave true` flag
- **PDF processing fails**: Check pdfplumber installation
- **Executable too large**: Use `--exclude-module` flags in PyInstaller

### User Issues
- **Windows Defender warnings**: Normal for new executables
- **PDF parsing errors**: Bank-specific formatting issues
- **Categorization accuracy**: Keyword matching limitations
- **Performance issues**: Large datasets or complex PDFs

## üìã Roadmap

### Short Term (Next Release)
- [ ] Improved PDF parsing for more bank formats
- [ ] Better error messages and user guidance
- [ ] Enhanced mobile responsiveness
- [ ] More export format options

### Long Term (Future Releases)
- [ ] Budget planning features
- [ ] Goal tracking and savings targets
- [ ] Investment tracking
- [ ] Multi-currency support
- [ ] Cloud sync (optional)
